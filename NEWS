Changes in version 1.7 2015-01-26
-----------------------------------

  o Added argument "xreg" for external regressors in function "stsmFit". 
    This function is the main interface to package "stsm" used by package 
    "tsoutliers". "xreg" is defined within the "stsm" class object but
    having "xreg" as argument in "stsmFit" is more convenient for "tsoutliers".

Changes in version 1.6 2015-01-24
-----------------------------------

  o Added "\VignetteIndexEntry" to "stsm.Rnw" file.
    It wasn't reported by "R CMD check --as-cran stsm" run under R-devel
    but it was reported by "R CMD check --as-cran stsm_1.6.tar.gz" as 
    required by CRAN policies.

Changes in version 1.5 2015-01-24
-----------------------------------

  o Packages "stsm.class" (version 1.3) and "stsm" have been merged.
    The S4 class from package "stsm.class" and related methods as well as 
    the remaining functions of the package are now defined in package "stsm".

  o Function "datagen.stsm" takes now the initial state vector from the 
    input argument "model". If NULL, it is set to zeros.
    Suggested at http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/125946/.

  o Function "maxlik.td.optim" and "maxlik.fd.optim": 
    The standard errors of parameter estimates are set to NULL for the 
    optimization methods that do not return the Hessian matrix (e.g. "AB-NM").
    In previous version an error was returned since for those methods 
    no Hessian matrix could be found to be inverted.

  o Fixed file 'index.html' in the 'doc' directory and validated 
    at <http://validator.w3.org/> as HTML 4.01 Transitional.

  o pdf files attached to the package have been removed. Those files 
    made the .tar.gz file a bit large in size. The information contained 
    in those files has been moved to more appropriate places. A small 
    vignette has been added containing a basic example and references to 
    further material available from the author's website.

Changes in version 1.4 2014-07-22
-----------------------------------

  o Added a document describing the package in vignettes directory.
    A duplicate of the document was required in directory "stsm/inst/doc"
    in order to pass the R CMD check. Other solutions can be possible  
    in order to include the pdf: for example the package "tsoutlies" provides an 
    "index.html" file "doc" directory so that the suplementary pdf 
    file is shown in the main help page of the package. But this way, 
    the pdf is not detected as a vignette and is not shown on CRAN web site of the package.
    
  o "mloglik.td" and "mloglik.fd": 
    These functions have been adapted for the case where the input model 
    contains external regressors. The argument "xreg" is removed and information 
    from the slot "xreg" in the input model is used since this information has been 
    added to the "stsm" class defined in package "stsm.class".

  o "mloglik.td.deriv": 
    Added argument "convergence = c(0.001, length(model@y))".

  o "mloglik.td.deriv" and "mloglik.td.grad": 
    The gradient and the information matrix (in the former function) are now 
    obtained with respect to the coefficients of external regressors that 
    may be defined in the "stsm" object.

  o "mloglik.fd.deriv" and "mloglik.fd.grad": 
    The gradient, the Hessian and the information matrix are now 
    obtained with respect to the coefficients of external regressors that 
    may be defined in the "stsm" object.

  o "maxlik.td.scoring" and "maxlik.fd.scoring":
    As the analytical derivatives are now available also for the 
    coefficients of external regressors, they are used used in 
    the scoring algorithms. The current approach seems to work better 
    than in the previous version where the vector of parameters was split
    in two vectors (one for the variance parameters and other for the 
    externa regressors). Before, the coefficients of the external regressors 
    were obtained (at each step of the procedure) in a linear regression 
    (OLS or frequency domain linear regression). Now, the availability of 
    analytical derivatives allows including these coefficients in the 
    updating equation of the scoring algorithm.

  o "maxlik.td.optim" and "maxlik.fd.optim": 
    - Removed argument "hessian" and set fixed to TRUE. The Hessian is 
    returned and is used to compute the standard errors of parameter 
    estimates. This way is more convenient because when printing the output 
    the standard errors will be already available in the "stsmFit" 
    object and do not need to be computed whenever the object is printed.

    - These functions have been adapted for the case where external  
    regressors are defined in the input model.

    - The coefficients of external regressors (if any) are not removed 
    from the slot "pars" of the output object, they are no longer placed 
    separately in a list "xreg" containing the regressors, estimates and 
    standard errors.

  o "maxlik.td.optim": 
    Fixed the sign of the value of the log-likelihood that was reported.
    The element "loglik" in the in output list stored the value of 
    the minus log-likelihood function, changed to (not-minus) log-likelihood.

  o Function "mll.step" defined within "maxlik.fd.scoring":
    set.pars(m, get.pars(m) + x * pd) changed to 
    set.pars(m, m@pars + x * pd), which is the correct   
    way if m@transPars is not null.

  o "maxlik.td.scoring": 
    the information matrix at the local optimum is now returned.

  o Methods "fitted" and "residuals": 
    the arguments "std.residuals" and "standardised" have been added, 
    respectively in each method. By default, "fitted" returns 
    the standardised residuals (as in previous versions); "residuals" does 
    not standardise the residuals by default because that way is more 
    convenient when used in package "tsoutliers".

   o Method "print.stsmFit" has been simplified by taking advantage of 
     new output (optimHessian, analytical Hessian or information matrix) 
     returned by the functions that fit the structural time series model.

Changes in version 1.3 2014-05-29
-----------------------------------

  o NAMESPACE: the functions "KalmanFilter", "KF", "KF.deriv.C", "KS" and 
    "make.KF.args" are imported instead of importing the whole "KFKSDS" package.

  o DESCRIPTION: packages "KFSKSD" and "stsm.class" are moved 
    from the "Depends" field to the "Imports" field.

  o The Expetation-Maximization algorithm can now be executed in parallel. 
    The function "mclapply" from package "parallel" is used. The number of 
    parallel processes can be specified in argument "num.cores". By default 
    it is set equal to the number of CPU cores.

  o Added argument "xreg" in functions "mloglik.fd" and "mloglik.td". 
    External regressor variables can be passed to these functions.

  o The concatenation of the elements in the list returned by 
    "maxlik.fd.optim" and "maxlik.td.optim" has been corrected. 
    Before, the Hessian matrix was not concatenated as a matrix element 
    but each cell was split in different elements in the list.
    "res2 <- c(list(), hessian = res$hessian)"
    was changed to
    "res2 <- c(list(), list(hessian = res$hessian))".

  o In order to reduce the size of the package, the data sets of simulated 
    series "llm" and "llmseas" have been removed. The first series of "llmseas" 
    is kept in the "data" directory because it is used in the examples of 
    the documentation.
    The complete data sets can be generated by means of the scripts 
    "datagen-llm.R" and "datagen-llmseas.R" of the "sims" directory.

Changes in version 1.2 2014-01-20
-----------------------------------

  o Fixed the warning reported by compiler 
    "ISO C++ forbids variable length array ‘v’ [-Wvla]"
    in file "KFKSDS-steady-v2.cpp".
  
  o Removed some unused variables from files "KFKSDS-steady-v2.cpp" and 
    "KFKSDS-steady.cpp".

Version 1.1 2014-01-26
-----------------------------------

  o First version on CRAN.

Version 1.0 2014-01-25
-----------------------------------

  o First version submitted to CRAN.
