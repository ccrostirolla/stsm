Version: 1.3 2014-05-29
------------------------

  o NAMESPACE: the functions "KalmanFilter", "KF", "KF.deriv.C", "KS" and 
    "make.KF.args" are imported instead of importing the whole "KFKSDS" package.

  o DESCRIPTION: packages "KFSKSD" and "stsm.class" are moved 
    from the "Depends" field to the "Imports" field.

  o The Expetation-Maximization algorithm can now be executed in parallel. 
    The function "mclapply" from package "parallel" is used. The number of 
    parallel processes can be specified in argument "num.cores". By default 
    it is set equal to the number of CPU cores.

  o Added argument "xreg" in functions "mloglik.fd" and "mloglik.td". 
    External regressor variables can be passed to these functions.

  o The concatenation of the elements in the list returned by 
    "maxlik.fd.optim" and "maxlik.td.optim" has been corrected. 
    Before the Hessian matrix was not concatenated as a matrix element 
    but each cell was split in different elements in the list.
    "res2 <- c(list(), hessian = res$hessian)"
    was changed to
    "res2 <- c(list(), list(hessian = res$hessian))".

  o In order to reduce the size of the package, the data sets of simulated 
    series "llm" and "llmseas" have been removed. The first series of "llmseas" 
    is kept in the "data" directory because it is used in the examples of 
    the documentation.
    The complete data sets can be generated by means of the scripts 
    "datagen-llm.R" and "datagen-llmseas.R" of the "sims" directory.

Version: 1.2 2014-01-20
------------------------

  o Fixed the warning reported by compiler 
    "ISO C++ forbids variable length array ‘v’ [-Wvla]"
    in file "KFKSDS-steady-v2.cpp".
  
  o Removed some unused variables from files "KFKSDS-steady-v2.cpp" and 
    "KFKSDS-steady.cpp".

Version: 1.1 2014-01-26
------------------------

  o First version on CRAN.

Version: 1.0 2014-01-25
